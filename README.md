## About

- Code and data for McArthur et al. “Reconstructing the 3D genome organization of Neanderthals reveals that chromatin folding shaped phenotypic and sequence divergence”
- Manuscript preprint: [TBD]
- Most of the analysis and figure-generation was done in the `bin/Neanderthal_3D_Genome.ipynb` with python 3.6.10 (see dependencies in `environment.yml`). It is not recommended to run this notebook from start-to-finish, but to run individual sections for the analysis you want to replicate. All custom files used are in this repo but there many be some additional files used downloaded from other resources (e.g. eQTLs from GTEx). These publicly available resources are all linked and cited in the methods section of the paper (section “Data availability”). To run Akita on your own sequences, please see the Akita repo: [https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita).

## Manifest

### bin/

- `Neanderthal_3D_Genome.ipynb` - Ipython/Jupyter notebook in python for analysis and figure generating code. It is organized by sub-section and figure to align with the presentation of results from the paper. Other python scripts are also launched from this notebook so if you want example usage for the other python scripts (below), check this out. Sections include:
    
    ![toc](toc.png)
    
- `environment.yml`- List and version of packages/dependencies used in Anaconda environment for all python scripts in this project
- `compareCellTypes.py` - Runs Akita on positions across the genome to compare HFF and ESC results, used for a supplemental figure. See `Neanderthal_3D_Genome.ipynb` for how this was parallelized.
- `inSilicoMutagenesis.py` - Conducts in silico mutagenesis over a file of 1 Mb windows across the genome (replace archaic-specific alleles one by one and run akita and comparisons). See `Neanderthal_3D_Genome.ipynb` for how this was parallelized.
- `goEnrichment.py`- Generates empirical distribution of HPO/GWAS annotation enrichment for the null hypothesis so we can calculate p values and enrichment statistics for observed counts
- `goEnrichmentEmpiricalFDR.py` - Used to generate an expected number of false positives for ontology enrichment in order to calculate FDR-corrected P values (q)
- generate3Dgenome.py - in progress, runs Akita across genome
- comparisons3Dgenome.py - in progress, compares Akita outputs across genome
- comparisonsSequence.py - in progress, compares sequence divergence across the genome
- expected3DgenomeDivergence.py - in progress, generates empiric distribution of 3D differences based on shuffling sequence differences
- locateSeqDifferences.py - in progress, finds sequence differences between two individuals
- `akita_model/` & `basenji/` From Akita CNN model, from here: [https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita)
